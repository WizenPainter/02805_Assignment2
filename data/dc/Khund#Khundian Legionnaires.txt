==Khundian Legionnaires== =\nDuring the [[Legion of Super-Heroes#\"Five Years Later\"|\"Five Years Later\"]] arc of Legion continuity, Mordru casts a massive spell allowing him to animate and control the corpses of dead warriors throughout United Planets territory, and use them as an invasion force.  U.P. worlds which were conquered by the Khundian empire are not spared from this phenomenon, prompting the Khunds to form a temporary alliance with the Legion. Four superpowered Khunds join the Legion: '''Firefist''', a cyborg; his wife '''Veilmist''', a teleporter; '''Blood Claw''', who possesses indestructible claws; and '''Flederweb''', a winged bounty hunter.<ref>''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 4) #44 (June 1993)</ref>\n\nIncluded in the animated undead force that invaded the planet Sklar are corpses of the many deceased members of the Legion.  Blood Claw is killed by Magnetic Kid's undead body.<ref>''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 4) #46 (August 1993)</ref> Firefist attempts to murder [[Devlin O'Ryan]], but is seemingly killed himself when Devlin's reflective power repels the Khund's weapon blast back at him.<ref>''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 4) #47 (September 1993)</ref> The group manages to defeat Mordru, and the Khunds force Veilmist and Flederweb to resign from the Legion.<ref>''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 4) #48 (October 1993)</ref> Some time later, it is revealed that Firefist survived,<ref name = \"LSH57\">''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 4) #57 (May 1994)</ref> and that the Khunds have initiated a plot to destroy [[Weber's World]].  Veilmist offers to assist the Legion in foiling the plot, but is killed by Firefist.<ref>''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 4) #58 (June 1994)</ref>  Flederweb is revealed to be not a Khund, but a mind-controlled member of an unspecified alien race.<ref name = \"LSH57\"/>  After he is freed from Khundian control and helps the Legion save Weber's World, Flederweb joins the [[Heroes of Lallor]].<ref>''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 4) #59 (July 1994)</ref>\n\nThe events of the \"Five Years Later\" era were erased from mainstream DC continuity following the ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]'' limited series. Thus, the saga of the Khundian Legionnaires is currently viewed as non-canonical. However, Veilmist, Firefist, and a shot of Flederweb's arm appeared in ''[[Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds]]'' #5, among dozens of Legionnaires pulled out of alternate realities.<ref>''Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds'' #5</ref>\n
