==Fictional history== \nThe Xenobrood are four superbeings processed from thousand year old alien crystals discovered by [[archaeologist]] Zecharia Leight on a dig in [[Kuwait]] near the [[Iraq]] border. Leight discovers several [[Sumer]]ian [[cuneiform]] tablets and a chrome cylinder in [[Archaeological dig#Stratification|archaeological strata]] dated to the [[4th millennium BCE]]. He takes the Sumerian cylinder to both [[NASA]] and [[S.T.A.R. Labs]], neither organization was able to analyze it. He ends up taking the cylinder to Creighton Engineering, and their \"[[Spectrometer|Laser Enhanced Spectrographic Analysis]]\" process was able to uncover the fact that the cylinder surface was etched with a [[holographic]] record that displays Sumerian glyphs. Leight later discovers that the cylinder contained four [[walnut]] sized [[crystal]]s, the crystals rapidly develop into \"four lumps of super-dense [[protoplasm]]\" when submerged in seawater and exposed to sunlight. With the help of Lorna Copely owner and founder of Genetrix Inc. Zecharia is able to grow all four forms to maturity. The four awaken fully clothed, mentally mature and self-aware thanks to a psionic link and \"download\" from Leight's mind.<ref>''Xenobrood'' #0 (October 1994)</ref>\n\nThe four declare the \"cerebral data transfer\" from Leight's mind to be complete, but a lot of data was already pre-programmed into their [[DNA]]. The members of the Xenobrood were supposedly created as \"organic robots\", drone servants used as miners by an alien race named the Vimanians who had made contact with the ancient Sumerians.<ref>''Xenobrood'' #1 (November 1994)</ref><ref>''Xenobrood'' #6 (April 1995)</ref>\n\nWith [[Superman]]'s help the Xenobrood, Leight and Copely explore an ancient abandoned alien laboratory base, and defeat a three-eyed, white-haired Vimanian named Lord Vimana, and the members of his \"Vimanian Bestiary\". Lord Vimana is the last true survivor of the Vimanian overlords who created the Xenobrood, he is served by an army of human [[cloning|clones]]. The members of his Bestiary are four organic crystal drones named Kohli ([[Kali]]), Gargol ([[Gargoyle]]), Tauran ([[Minotaur]]), and Mahduse ([[Medusa]]).\n
