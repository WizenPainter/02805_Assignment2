==J.A.K.E. 1== =\nThe next G.I. Robot is designed by Professor Thompson of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. In ''Weird War Tales'' #101, it is deployed to a Pacific island alongside the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] to fight the Japanese military and placed under the control of Sergeant Coker. Although the robot is technically named \"'''J'''ungle '''A'''utomatic '''K'''iller - '''E'''xperimental Number 1\" (J.A.K.E. 1), Coker gives the robot the nickname of the G.I. Robot. Coker is skeptical of the robot's abilities, but it soon earns his trust.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n
