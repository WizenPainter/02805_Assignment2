==Plot== \n[[Batman]], [[Jason Todd|Robin]], and [[Wonder Woman]] visit the [[Fortress of Solitude]] with gifts on [[Superman]]'s birthday, [[February 29]]. They find him catatonic, with an alien plant wrapped around his body. The alien conqueror [[Mongul]] reveals himself, explaining that the plant \u2013 the \"Black Mercy\" \u2013 has incapacitated Superman while it consumes his bio-aura, feeding him a realistic dream based on his heart's deepest desire. In his catatonic state, Superman dreams of a normal life on his long-destroyed home planet of [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]], happily married to [[Lyla Lerrol]] with children.\n\nWhile Wonder Woman battles the more powerful Mongul, Batman and Robin try to free Superman. Superman's fantasy takes a dark turn as his father [[Jor-El]], whose prediction of Krypton's doom was unfulfilled, has become discredited and embittered. Superman's mother [[Lara (comics)|Lara]] has died from the \"Eating Sickness\", further isolating Jor-El from his family. Even the death of his brother [[Zor-El]] has not reconciled Jor-El to his sister-in-law [[Alura (DC Comics)|Alura]] and niece [[Kara Zor-El]].\n\nKryptonian society has undergone political upheaval, and the disgraced Jor-El has become chairman of an extremist movement \"the Sword of [[Rao (comics)|Rao]]\", calling for a return to Krypton's \"noble and unspoiled\" past through the establishment of a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] theocracy under the leadership of Brother Lor-Em. \n\nThe [[Phantom Zone]], Krypton's other-dimensional prison system developed by Jor-El, has become unpopular with the public. Kara Zor-El is assaulted by anti-Zone protesters, for whom the criminal [[Jax-Ur]], sentenced to eternity in the Zone, is a martyr. Kal-El decides to take his family away from the city for protection, only to witness Jor-El presiding over a political demonstration reminiscent of a [[Fascism|Fascist]] rally, which dissolves into a riot between anti-Zone protesters and the Sword of Rao.\n\nSuperman gradually wakes from his increasingly disturbing dream, which finally dissolves as his \"son\" Van-El slips away at the [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]] crater. Batman pries the Mercy from Superman's chest, and the plant latches on to him instead, submerging Batman in his own dream, in which his parents\u2019 murder is prevented when [[Thomas Wayne]] disarms [[Joe Chill]]. Superman awakens, infuriated by the Mercy's attack, and attacks Mongul before he can kill Wonder Woman. They battle across the Fortress, causing massive damage.\n\nRobin uses Mongul's discarded gauntlets to pry the Mercy off Batman, stuffing the plant inside a gauntlet to carry it safely toward the battle. Subduing Mongul, Superman is distracted by the sight of the statues of his parents, and Mongul gains the upper hand, but Robin drops the Mercy on him. Seized by the plant, Mongul is submerged in his own fantasy, in which he swats the Mercy aside, kills the heroes and goes on to conquer Earth and the universe.\n\nTending to their wounds, Batman mentions to Wonder Woman that his fantasy included him marrying [[Batwoman (Kathy Kane)|Kathy Kane]] and having a teenage daughter, while Wonder Woman confesses envy that she did not find out her heart's desire. Planning to imprison Mongul in a [[black hole]] across the galaxy, Superman unwraps his gifts. Wonder Woman brought a replica of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]] made by the \"gem-smiths\" of [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Paradise Island]], prompting Superman to hide his own replica of the Bottle City at super-speed. Batman\u2019s gift turns out to be another plant \u2013 a new breed of rose named \"The Krypton\" \u2013 which was stepped on during the fight. Musing that it is perhaps for the best, Superman asks that someone make coffee while he cleans up the Fortress. Deep in his fantasy, Mongul is content.\n
