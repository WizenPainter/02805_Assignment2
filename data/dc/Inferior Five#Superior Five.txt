==Superior Five== \nIn the miniseries ''[[Villains United]]'', the Inferior Five were paid homage as a group of supervillains who are tentatively known as the Superior Five. Each member has the abilities of an I5 member but, aside from being evil, are serious and modern-styled characters. They consist of:\n\n* '''Tremor''' (Awkwardman)\n* '''Hindenburg''' (the Blimp)\n* '''Splitshot''' (White Feather)\n* '''Lagomorph''' (the Dumb Bunny)\n* '''Jongleur''' (Merryman)\n\nLittle has been seen of these characters except for one panel in ''Villains United'' #4 and a few shots of them in the background in the same issue. They are among the imprisoned supervillains in ''[[Salvation Run]]''. Jongleur is one of the villains sent to retrieve the Get Out of Hell Free card from the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]].\n
