==Publication history== \nThe villains of the crossover were the formerly imprisoned survivors of a race of alien parasites named '''Angon''', '''Gemir''', '''Glonth''', '''Lissik''', '''Pritor''', '''Venev''', and '''Slodd''' that could shapeshift into [[humanoid]] form. These humanoid forms were based on the initial entities they first encountered, a squadron of [[L.E.G.I.O.N.]] soldiers, most of whom perished. The bite of the Bloodlines Parasites was administered to the back of the neck by a mouth-within-a-mouth. This bite is intended to remove the spinal fluid for sustenance. This usually killed the victim for food, but occasionally awakened [[superhuman]] powers in the recipient. This was also the means by which the creatures could reproduce.\n\nEach of the annuals involved in the crossover used this [[plot device]] to introduce a new super-powered character to the [[DC Universe]]. The ''Bloodlines'' crossover event spanned 23 of DC's regular titles and wrapped up in the two-part miniseries ''Bloodbath''. The alien parasites that came to Earth to gather spinal fluid sacrificed themselves to help birth a gigantic alien known as the '''Taker'''. Many long-term heroes were absorbed into the monster, only to be saved by the very heroes the parasites had created.\n\nThis series spun off into the ''Blood Pack'' miniseries. [[Gunfire (comics)|Gunfire]] also had a short-lived series. Some of the heroes created by the aliens died in the 2005-2006's ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' event.\n\nThe only New Blood character to succeed as an independent property was [[Hitman (DC Comics)|Hitman]], who first appeared in 1993's ''[[The Demon (comics)|Demon]] Annual'' and went on to star in his own sixty-issue [[Hitman (DC Comics)#The series|ongoing series]] from 1996 to 2001 written by [[Garth Ennis]] and drawn by [[John McCrea (comics)|John McCrea]].\n\nIn fact, of the few times New Blood characters made appearances after the ''Bloodlines'' event, a majority of the time they are killed off. ''Faces of Evil: Prometheus'' and ''JLA/Hitman'' #1 are examples. The former featured a brief cameo of the remaining members of the Bloodpack, only to have a majority of the team killed or maimed by the titular villain; it was referenced in the ''Justice League of America'' tie-in to the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' crossover, where [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]] mockingly mentions that most of the Blood Pack heroes had died and were quickly forgotten by the rest of the superhero community. ''Hitman/JLA'' #1, set before this, sees the [[Flash (comics)|Wally West Flash]] mention the Bloodline heroes' long casualty list and states, with irritation, that most of them are incompetent and are constantly trying to 'team up' with the League, while [[Kyle Rayner|Green Lantern Kyle Rayner]] simply sums them up with: \"Those guys are lame. I mean, they are ''really lame''\".\n\n''Hitman'' and ''Hitman/JLA'' both offered up sequels to ''Bloodlines''. The first had the [[CIA]] trying to duplicate the power-giving effects of the parasites. The second, set chronologically earlier, had a separate breed of Bloodlines parasites. ''Hitman/JLA'' also had a scene showing the [[White House]] taking the Bloodlines parasites as so big a threat that they were willing to launch nuclear missiles at the Justice League to prevent the parasites from reaching Earth again.\n
