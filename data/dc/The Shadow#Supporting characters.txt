==Supporting characters== =\n[[File:The Shadow and Margo Lane.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Margo Lane]] and The Shadow, art by [[Alex Ross]]]]\n\nThe Shadow has a network of agents who assist him in his war on crime. These include:\n\n* Harry Vincent - A man who tries to commit [[suicide]] in the first Shadow story. The Shadow saves and recruits him, after which Vincent is a regular recurring character in the pulp stories and one of the most trusted agents.\n* Moses \"Moe\" Shrevnitz, a.k.a. \"Shrevvy\" - A cab driver who doubles as his chauffeur. The radio version of Shrevvy is dim-witted and does not knowingly work for The Shadow, aiding Lamont Cranston on many occasions. [[Peter Boyle]] performed the role in the [[The Shadow (1994 film)|1994 film]].\n* [[Margo Lane]] - A socialite created for the radio drama and introduced in the debut episode \"The Death House Rescue\" as The Shadow's companion who loves him. Margo aids the Shadow in nearly every radio episode and was later introduced into the pulps as one of his agents. [[Penelope Ann Miller]] performed the role in the 1994 film, in which Margo had the power of telepathy, allowing her to pierce The Shadow's hypnotic mental-clouding abilities.\n* Clyde Burke - A newspaper reporter who also is initially paid to collect news clippings for The Shadow.\n* Burbank - A radio operator who maintains contact between The Shadow and his agents. He was portrayed by [[Andre Gregory]] in the 1994 film.\n* Clifford \"Cliff\" Marsland - He first appeared in the ninth novel ''Mobsmen on the Spot''. A man with a checkered past known to The Shadow, he changed his name to Clifford Marsland. Having spent years in [[Sing Sing]] maximum security prison for a crime he did not commit, he is wrongly believed by the underworld to have murdered one or more people. He infiltrates gangs using his crooked reputation (the [[Green Hornet]] is often described as having a ''modus operandi'' similar to that of Marsland).\n* Dr. Rupert Sayre - The Shadow's personal physician.\n* Jericho Druke - A large, immensely strong black man.\n* Slade Farrow - He works with The Shadow to rehabilitate criminals.\n* Miles Crofton - He sometimes pilots The Shadow's [[autogyro]].\n* Claude Fellows - The only agent of The Shadow ever shown to be killed, in ''Gangdom's Doom'' (1931).\n* Rutledge Mann - A stockbroker who collects information, taking over for Claude Fellows after the latter's death. First appeared in ''Double Z'' (June 1, 1932). After his business failed and he acquired heavy debt, he was ready to commit suicide before The Shadow, knowing about his situation, recruited him.\n* Hawkeye - A reformed underworld snoop who trails gangsters and other criminals.\n* Myra Reldon - A female operative who uses the alias of Ming Dwan when in [[Chinatown]].\n* Dr. Roy Tam - The Shadow's contact man in New York's Chinatown. [[Sab Shimono]] portrayed him in the 1994 film, in which he provided valuable scientific information to Lamont Cranston, believing the latter to be an agent of The Shadow.\n\nThough initially wanted by the police, The Shadow also works with and through them, notably gleaning information from his many chats (as Cranston) at the Cobalt Club with NYPD Commissioner Ralph Weston and later Commissioner Wainwright Barth, who is also Cranston's uncle (portrayed by [[Jonathan Winters]] in the 1994 film). Weston believes Cranston is merely a rich playboy who dabbles in detective work out of curiosity. Another police contact is Detective (later Inspector) Joseph Cardona, a key character in many Shadow novels.\n\nIn contrast to the pulps, ''The Shadow'' [[radio drama]] limited the cast of major characters to The Shadow, Commissioner Weston, and Margo Lane, the last of whom was created for the radio series. Along with giving The Shadow a love interest, Margo was created because it was believed that including Harry Vincent as a regular would mean an overabundance of male characters (considering the criminals in the stories were usually male, too) and could possibly make it difficult for the audience to distinguish between the voices of so many male actors.<ref name=\"Tollin-5\">{{cite journal |last= Tollin |first= Anthony |title= The Shadow on the Radio |journal= The Shadow |issue= #5: The Salamanders and The Black Falcon |publisher= Nostalgia Ventures |date= February 2007 }}</ref> The radio script for \"The Death House Rescue\" (reprinted in ''The Shadow Scrapbook'') features Harry Vincent, but he did not appear in the actual radio broadcast or any episode of the radio drama series. Clyde Burke made occasional appearances, but not as an agent of The Shadow. Lieutenant Cardona was a minor character in several episodes. Moe Shrevnitz (identified only as \"Shrevvy\") made several appearances as a simple-minded acquaintance of Cranston and Lane who sometimes acted as their chauffeur, unaware Cranston was actually The Shadow.\n
