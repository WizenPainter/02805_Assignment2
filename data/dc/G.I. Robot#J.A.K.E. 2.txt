==J.A.K.E. 2== =\nJ.A.K.E. 1 is destroyed in ''Weird War Tales'' #111, but is replaced by J.A.K.E. 2, which continues to fight on various Pacific islands, including Dinosaur Island. It later teams with the [[Creature Commandos]]. J.A.K.E. 2 and the Creature Commandos are presumed killed when the rocket they are riding to [[Berlin]] misfires and heads into deep space (''Weird War Tales'' #124). The Creature Commandos are known to have survived, but J.A.K.E. 2's fate is unknown. The ''DC Comics Encyclopedia'' describes J.A.K.E. 2 as having survived into the [[31st century]].<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/> However, the Creature Commandos later gained possession of an entire army of mass-produced J.A.K.E.s. It is still unknown whether one of them is the ''original'' J.A.K.E. 2.<ref>''Justice League: Generation Lost'' #15 (2011)</ref>\n
