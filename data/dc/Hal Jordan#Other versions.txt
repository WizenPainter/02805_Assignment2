Despite the fact that both teams travel to both of their respective universes, this is one of the few comics featuring multiple universes that remains in (DC) continuity.

DC Comics.</ref>\n* In the alternate timeline of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event, Hal Jordan was reckless as a flying ace. He along with Carol Ferris was on an F-22 Raptor entering Western Europe territory before the [[Shark (comics)|Shark]] attacks. Hal forces the Shark to crash his jet into Carol's jet, and both of them barely got out of the ejection system. Upon their return to America, Hal was about to fly the jet. However, he witnesses a spaceship crash to Earth and was approached by the ship's survivor, Abin Sur, asking for help.<ref>''Flashpoint: Hal Jordan'' #1 (June 2011).

However, he became an unwitting pawn to both Sinestro and Superman.\n** In the prequel to the ''[[Injustice 2]]'' game, after Superman's Regime has been defeated, Hal admits his guilt and accepts full responsibility for his past deeds as an unwitting pawn to the Regime and Yellow Lantern. As he is a very important figure to the Green Lantern Corps, the Guardians enact a rehabilitation program as part of his atonement. Due to his newfound hatred towards Sinestro for tricking him into believing that Guy Gardner killed John Stewart, he gets into a fight with him and unintentionally catches the Red Lantern Corps' attention, giving them the opportunity to locate Sinestro before he is sent to another prison. During the rehabilitation program, Hal is often visited by Guy's spirit, who reveals himself to be a manifestation of Hal's guilt. After a brutal attack by Atrocitus and the Red Lantern Corps, Hal rescues the remaining Green Lanterns and becomes a Red Lantern to ensure their escape from the planet. Upon learning that Red Lanterns recruited Starro, Hal still has the remaining will to break free from the red power ring's influence to warn the other Green Lanterns and Guardians about this. He cuts his finger that has a red power ring to proof his attempt to warn the Green Lanterns and Guardians about the Red Lanterns' attack on Oa using Starro, but was too late to prepare the enemy Lanterns' quick arrival. Even with the help from Titans members Starfire, Wonder Girl and Superboy, including Jaime Reyes/the current Blue Beetle, Booster Gold and Lobo, but still no match against the Red Lanterns' might thanks to Starro's mind control on other Green Lanterns and the Guardians, Hal has no choice to join the fight as a Green Lantern while overcoming his guilt on his own merit and needs Sinestro's aid only temporarily, including turning Lobo into a Green Lantern without any choice. Thanks to the interference of Brainiac's army for causing the Red Lanterns' retreat and leaving Starro to handle its destructive reign on Oa, who attempts to take a Kryptonian DNA sample from Superboy, the Green Lanterns and the Titans won; however, Sinestro seemingly died sacrificing his life saving his daughter from Starro's control, Booster Gold sacrifices his life to save Jaime, who implanted the Blue Beetle Scarab to self-destruct Starro once and for all, while Superboy and Wonder Girl are now staying safe with the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in a distant future to clear Superman and Wonder Woman's names from their past reign. Guy urges Hal to keep looking for the true meaning of redemption to make up for his past mistakes, before departing for the afterlife.\n* In the possible future of ''[[The New 52: Futures End|Futures End]]'', Hal Jordan had left his role as Corps leader behind, promising to never again leave Earth unprotected after a gruesome war killed thousands of people, including Hal's mother. Living what looks like a bachelor's life in Coast City, Hal learns from his deceased father that Krona has become the new leader of the Black Lantern Corps, which forces Hal to renege on his vow and to take them head on with only the help of a new ally, Relic. The ensuing battle occurs near the [[Source Wall]], which is a miniature Blackest Night version, with Relic giving Hal access to the rest of the emotional spectrum needed to handle his foes. As Hal is quickly overrun, he sacrifices himself to end the Black Lantern threat once and for all. Critically wounded and barely alive, Hal is placed inside the Source Wall, just like Relic was.<ref>''Green Lantern: Futures End'' #1. DC Comics.</ref>\n* In the crossover series ''Star Trek/Green Lantern: The Spectrum War'', the return of Nekron in a not-too-distant future results in the complete destruction of the DC Universe,<ref>''Star Trek/Green Lantern: The Spectrum War'' #3. DC Comics.</ref> with Hal Jordan and the other members of the original 'new Guardians' the only survivors after Ganthet initiates the 'Last Light' protocol, banishing all surviving ring-wielders to the [[Star Trek (2009 film)|alternate ''Star Trek'' universe]], where his corpse is collected by the USS ''Enterprise''.<ref>''Star Trek/Green Lantern: The Spectrum War'' #1. DC Comics.</ref> After Hal makes contact with the ''Enterprise'' and learns of Nekron's return in this universe, he assists the crew in thwarting the new ring-bearers, as well as dealing with the threats of Atrocitus, Sinestro and Larfleeze. With Nekron defeated, Hal joins the ''Enterprise'' in their mission of exploration.<ref>''Star Trek/Green Lantern: The Spectrum War'' #6. DC Comics.</ref> In the sequel, Hal leads the ''Enterprise'' crew in tracking down the Oa of this universe, culminating in Kirk becoming the first Green Lantern native to the ''Star Trek'' universe, accompanying Hal as he prepares to search for this world's version of Krypton.\n* In the in-continuity company-wide story ''[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]'', the ''Zero Hour''-era Hal Jordan and the people of Metropolis are stolen from that timeline immediately before the reboot event at the end of ''Zero Hour'' by [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] and stored on the planet Telos along with cities of heroes and villains from other eras and Earths of the DC Comics multiverse.<ref>''Convergence: Green Lantern/Parallax'' #1\u20132. DC Comics.</ref> The villain [[Deimos (comics)|Deimos]], also on the planet, steals the power of the [[Rip Hunter|Time Masters]] and attempts to remake the multiverse in his image, only to be killed by Hal Jordan using the power of Parallax and still vengeful over the loss of Coast City. This attack causes the multiverse to begin to unravel, prompting a crisis event from which it will not survive.<ref>''Convergence'' #7. DC Comics.</ref> When Brainiac explains that he can send the heroes home, he is prevented by damage from the original ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' event from restoring the universe to normal. Seeking redemption for his recent actions, Parallax volunteers to go with the pre-''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' era Superman to the time of the original ''Crisis''.

DC Comics.</ref>\n* In the series ''[[Green Lantern: Earth One]]'', set in the near future, Hal Jordan is a former astronaut who worked on a joint project between NASA and Monarcha Energy to build Arrowhead, an orbital platform which was intended to be used for deep space exploration, but which Jordan discovered was in fact a [[space weapon]]. It is implied that Arrowhead was used in a coup which ushered in an authoritarian regime. Feeling responsible for not speaking up, and disillusioned with humanity, Hal took a job as an asteroid miner with [[Ferris Aircraft|Ferris Galactic]] in an attempt to leave Earth. Jordan stumbles across one of the few remaining power rings in the galaxy, as the Green Lantern Corps was wiped out by the [[Manhunters (DC Comics)|Manhunters]] generations ago. Thrust into the wider galaxy, Jordan teams up with [[Kilowog]], a ring-bearer and the descendant of a Green Lantern, and begins searching for allies against the Manhunters. After repeatedly failing to enlist the aid of the few remaining ring-bearers, Jordan is eventually captured while his ring is drained and enslaved by the Manhunters on a planet that is revealed to be Oa. He discovers the presumed destroyed Central Power Battery, and is able to rally the bearers of all surviving power rings to join him in rescuing the Battery and freeing the slaves. With the Battery restored and the power rings' full powers unlocked, the Green Lantern Corps is revived under the leadership of [[Arisia Rrab|Arisia]]. Hal returns to Earth and reveals his identity as a Green Lantern to his Captain, Amy Seaton.<ref>''Green Lantern: Earth One Volume 1''. DC Comics.</ref>\n
