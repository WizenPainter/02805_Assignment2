==Publication history== \nKevin Smith discussed the character in a 2007 interview:\n{{cquote|When I did Green Arrow, I went with Onomatopoeia for a villain, just because I loved that word, and it kind of formed the character inasmuch as he would say sounds out loud. It only kind of works \u2013 I think \u2013 on a comic book page because if you have a gun going off, they usually write BLAM! and then you can have, you know, the character saying \"BLAM!\" in a word balloon, but like if you tried to do that cinematically you can't really rock it. A gun in a film sounds completely different. It doesn't read as BLAM! and so to have a dude say BLAM!...I think it works great in print and on a comic book page. I don't think that character would translate very well outside of that.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://azhrialilu.com/article/25/interview-with-kevin-smith-aka-silent-bob|title=Interview with Kevin Smith aka Silent Bob|publisher=Azhrialilu|author=Lisa S|date=1 November 2007|access-date=2 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116015644/http://azhrialilu.com/article/25/interview-with-kevin-smith-aka-silent-bob|archive-date=16 November 2007}}</ref>}}\n
