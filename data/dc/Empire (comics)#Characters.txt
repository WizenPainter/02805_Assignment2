==Characters== \n*'''Golgoth'''&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Emperor]] of the world. He is human and at the beginning of the series it is revealed that his wife is dead but his daughter is still alive. He is ruthless and ensures the loyalty of his Ministers through the use of a highly addictive booster drug called ''Eucharist''. His powers seemingly come from his armour; he is never in the series seen without his mask. His powers include hand blasts and teleportation, a technology that greatly helped him in his fight against the world.\n*'''Delfi'''&nbsp;\u2013 Golgoth's daughter resides in the Empire's citadel and is treated by the Emperor and its people as a secluded princess. Golgoth keeps his business and ruthlessness secret from her and she seemingly knows nothing about his real actions. She spends the majority of her day studying or reading books that are recommended to her by the Emperor. However, the girl reveals herself to be not as innocent as first suspected as the series progresses.\n*'''Xanna'''&nbsp;\u2013 Minister of Execution. She is the Emperor's chief assassin but, being bored with her position (because the Emperor has killed most of his enemies), she chooses to ponder the origins of the Eucharist drug.\n*'''Tumbril'''&nbsp;\u2013 Minister of Discipline. The Emperor's chief Torturer who uses pain and fear to extract information from the enemies of the Empire.\n*'''Lohkyn'''&nbsp;\u2013 The newly appointed Minister of Espionage and is the character whose point of view the reader sees through much of the series.
