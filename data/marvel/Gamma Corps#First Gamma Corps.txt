Using Hulk's [[DNA]] (acquired from the scene of a battle with [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]), these people were transformed into gamma-irradiated [[supersoldier]]s. The team was assembled by [[John Ryker|General Ryker]] with the objective of destroying the Hulk.\n\nAccording to the Marvel previews, they are armed with a variety of military weapons and have been trained to destroy the Hulk. Gideon, Grey and Mess are in the group because they hold the Hulk responsible for the loss of their loved ones, while Griffin and Prodigy hold more personal grudges against the green goliath.\n\nTheir first mission involves tracking down the failed Hulk-copy experiment Private Benjamin Tibbits (AKA [[Flux (comics)|Flux]]) and killing him.\n\nThey later appear in ''[[World War Hulk]]''. After failing to defeat the Hulk, the Gamma Corps discover that he was not directly responsible for their individual situations, so they pursue the people who were, the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]].\n\nThe Gamma Corps return in the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)#Dark Reign: Made Men|Dark Reign: Made Men]]'' series. Without the backing of the US government, the Gamma Corps become fugitives in hiding, but they continue to search for each Illuminati member. Prodigy believes Iron Man is approaching their base, alerting the group, but the Corps is surprised when it is Iron Patriot who arrives. Afraid he has come to arrest them, the group lashes out, unwilling to listen to him. Once Prodigy incapacitates the Patriot, Grey allows him to speak. He offers the Corps a chance at redemption by becoming his [[bounty hunter]]s, bringing unregistered superhumans to justice. Eager to regain a purpose, the Gamma Corps agree.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://marvel.com/catalog/?id=12429 |title=Dark Reign: Made Men One Shot (2009) #1 |publisher=Marvel.com |access-date= 2013-09-02}}</ref>\n\nThe Gamma Corps later encounter Hulk's Doc Green form.
