==The Hayes family== ==\n'''Gene''' and '''Alice Hayes''' (\"the Outcasts\") are [[Molly Hayes]]' parents. The two are telepathic [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] who posed as doctors.<ref name=\"Vol1#1\"/> Gene first appears as a very awkward man, unwilling to talk about his daughter's puberty. Alice is described a strong and caring mother, but still able to offer up her own daughter as a ransom to capture the five other runaways.<ref name=\"Vol1#5\"/> When the Gibborim had called the Hayes for the first meeting, Gene and Alice had been getting harassed by the neighbors, who had thrown rocks at them for being mutants.<ref name=\"Vol1#13\"/> Just before a furious Gene was about to protect a whimpering Alice, the two had been called forth by the Gibborim. This led to the Hayeses' strong hatred towards humans, a reason they were willing to conspire with the Deans to kill the human members of the Pride and ensure the six tickets in paradise for themselves, Molly, and the three Deans.<ref name=\"Vol1#16\"/> It was revealed early on that the Hayes had no idea Molly was a mutant herself, Molly having tested negative for the mutant gene, but when Molly's supposed puberty was actually her mutant genes kicking in, the Hayes were shocked.<ref name=\"Vol1#7\"/> The two are telepaths, capable of memory removal and [[sedation]], but this has been reversed on at least one occasion\u2014when they had wiped [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]]'s memory of ever encountering the Runaways, Cloak and Dagger traveled back to New York, where after receiving a blow to the head, Cloak remembered.<ref name=\"Vol1#17\"/>\n\nMolly had difficulty in believing her parents were villains for two main reasons: because of her age, and her strong empowering belief her parents were actually innocent people.<ref name=\"Vol1#18\"/> After Molly had escaped a villain named \"the Provost\", Molly rescued several other runaway children who had thought their parents villains and offered them a place on the team.<ref name=\"Vol2#14\"/>  When they rejected and said they would go to their families, Molly later had a dream of her parents, reminding her they would still be going to [[Disneyland]], and Molly admitting to her dream-mother that her whole experience as a runaway was a horrible nightmare.<ref name=\"Vol2#14\"/> The dream-Alice comforts Molly by telling her it was nothing but a dream, and not to worry, because she's home.<ref name=\"Vol2#14\"/>\n\n[[Emma Frost]] later mentions that she knew the Hayeses; [[Hellfire Club (comics)|The Hellfire Club]] had originally reached out for them, but the Hayeses refused. Frost tells [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] that the Hayeses were monsters and suggested that Molly was probably better off without them. Later, Molly and her chaperone [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] are captured by a super-villain seeking revenge against the Hayeses for stopping his bid for Pride territory and brutally massacring his men and sadistically torturing him seven years previously. He happily confronts Molly with the reality of her parents' evil and [[Sadomasochism|sadism]], telling her that her parents allegedly killed many people, including children, often for no reason and took pleasure in torturing them. He plans on exacting his revenge by killing Molly, though Wolverine manages to defeat him. Afterward, Wolverine comforts her, stating that her parents must have truly loved her despite being super-villains, though Molly accepts that they were \"bad people\" and realizes that she will never see her parents in the same light as before.<ref>''Runaways'' #10 (May 2009)</ref>\n\nWhen Molly is sent to stay with her grandmother after the team disbands, she learns that this grandmother was her direct maternal grandmother, who had taken in Molly's father when he ran away, and carried out various genetic research to give Molly's parents their powers, accounting for how Molly's parents could share the same mutant power. Molly's grandmother eventually reveals her true agenda to try and genetically recreate Molly's dead parents, but Molly rejects this idea, choosing instead to return to the Runaways as the team come back together.\n
