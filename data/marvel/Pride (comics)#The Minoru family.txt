==The Minoru family== ==\n'''Robert''' and '''Tina Minoru''' (\"the Magicians\") are [[Nico Minoru]]'s parents. The two are dark [[Magician (fantasy)|wizards]] who posed as an average, church-going, [[middle-class]] couple.<ref name=\"Vol1#1\"/><ref name=\"Vol1#16\">''Runaways'' #16</ref> The two are the least-liked by the Pride; in a holograph, it's revealed the Steins and Yorkes consider them unstable because they're magicians;<ref name=\"Vol2#26\">''Runaways'' vol. 2 #26</ref> the Deans and Hayes hate them because they're humans;<ref name=\"Vol1#16\"/> Geoffrey Wilder also criticizes Robert on one occasion.<ref name=\"Vol1#2\">''Runaways'' #2</ref> When the Gibborim had first abducted the Pride for the first meeting, the Minorus were on their wedding day.<ref name=\"Vol1#17\"/> Arriving in the Gibborim's chamber with the rest of the Pride, the two quickly unleashed a black hole of bats at the Pride.<ref name=\"Vol1#13\"/> In their first appearance, the two appear as an average couple, where Robert is unwilling to be late, and Tina is an ''[[Oprah Winfrey|Oprah]]'' fan.<ref name=\"Vol1#1\"/>  When the Runaways witness the Rite of Blood, they see that Robert conducts the enchanted spell of sacrifice.<ref name=\"Vol1#17\"/> The Runaways see the Minorus in action when they get ambushed at the Steins' laboratory; Tina conducts her powers using a mystical Staff known as the \"Staff of One\", and Robert conducts his powers through a spell book.<ref name=\"Vol1#4\"/> Tina attempted to stab Nico with the Staff, but, due to Nico's own innate magic and hereditary link with Tina, the Staff was absorbed by Nico, who kept it.<ref name=\"Vol1#3\"/> It is later hinted that there is more than one Staff of One, as shown when Bo, the first lady to a drug dealer in New York, knew of Nico's incantation and Chase commented that Nico had \"'''a''' Staff of One.\" The Minorus, though having mentioned that they only \"dabbled\" in the dark arts the first time the Pride was gathered, were given enough mystical power by the [[Gibborim (comics)|Gibborim]] to rule Los Angeles and even beyond. In the final battle with the Pride at the Marine Vivarium, Nico ignored the Wilders' and her parents' wishes to rule in the new world. Regardless, Tina screamed at Nico to run while she and Robert held back the Gibborim, a reason the Runaways were able to flee to safety.<ref name=\"Vol1#17\"/>\n\nThe Minorus are considered highly proficient spellcasters of the dark arts, able to evoke spells of various effects with spoken incantations and without, capable of conjuring bats from nowhere, conducting the Rite of Blood, garbing themselves and others in their costumes, summoning the Staff of One and an enchanted tome (the Abstract), summoning waterspouts, killing a genetically engineered prehistoric creature, teleporting a Majesdanian alien back to his home planetoid in another galaxy, freezing another, even a holder of the [[Staff of One]] in time, and project energy blasts of sufficient strength to hold off [[Gibborim (comics)|Elder Gods]] (if but for moments). The Minorus are involved with various other mystical matters such as [[Dormammu]] and Agamotto. Nevertheless, for whatever reason (presumably due to the lack of the [[Staff of One]] because Nico stole it), the Minorus appeared incapable, despite their immense power and experience in dark magic, of locating the Runaways, though they were but at most several miles from the Pride.\n\nWhen the Minorus combine their strength, without the usage of magical artifacts, they are capable of sending Frank Dean back to the planet he came from, while the Sorcerer Supreme [[Doctor Strange]], with access to all his own magical items at the Sanctum Sanctorum, claims he cannot bring the New Avengers to Japan through ''any'' magical means.\n\nRobert and Tina later appear in a dream that Nico has, where the two criticize Nico and call her a slut for kissing Alex, Chase, [[Topher (comics)|Topher]], and Victor.<ref name=\"Vol2#24\"/> Nico then overcomes her previous insecurities by quickly killing her parents in her dream by screaming a spell, \"and I liked you better dead!\"<ref name=\"Vol2#24\"/>\n\nThe Minorus are mentioned to Nico by Marie LaVeau, who reveals that they were acquaintances of hers, and that they were never fully committed to the Dark Path, only to the Pride, unlike Marie. Marie claims to Nico that the Minorus used her, gained her trust, and betrayed her, taking the valuable and extraordinarily powerful ''Black Mirror'' from her. The Mirror possessed the ability to gaze into other dimensions, and even the power to travel through time, \"if used correctly.\" Maries scathingly adds certain members of the Pride, such as the Yorkes, had access to the secrets of time traveling, which were shared not with the Minoru clan. The Minorus were so determined to learn about their own past and family secrets they used the Mirror to do so. Yet whatever vision they saw, it was so terrifying even they were unnerved and magically sealed the Mirror so none could ever use it again, instead causing a mere reflection to stare back at the beholder. Nico is told Marie requires her blood to unlock the Mirror's locking spell, and Nico herself does so, though also, as she intended, releases the Staff of One. Nico engages Marie in direct magical combat, and triumphs. However, after Nico unsuccessfully tries to utilize the power of the Mirror to revive Alex Wilder, Marie finds the last page of the Darkhold, and promises Nico that they will encounter each other again, leaving the teenage witch to stare at the shattered remains of the Black Mirror, indeed a mirror of her own life at the time.\n\nAfter their death, their influence still lives on\u2014the \"New Pride\" found their magical runestone as part of the ritual to summon [[Geoffrey Wilder]] to their present time, and uses more of their magical artifacts to their benefit, such as the Eye-Spy Cauldron to spy upon the Runaways and the chameleon glamour charm Wilder utilized to conceal his true identity by magically giving himself the voice and physical appearance of Chamber and Alex Wilder. The Minorus have also curiously made mention to the Spine of Agamotto, a benevolent powerful magical being who is the main patron of the [[Sorcerer Supreme]] and creator of the [[Eye of Agamotto]] to install a \"lummox\" as [[Arnold Schwarzenegger|Los Angeles's governor]]. Nico also assumed the security daemons in their hostel were among the old defense spells of the Minorus, and according to her, the Silver Bullet Gang (a gang of werewolves) were actually driven out from Los Angeles by her parents.\n\nMonk Theppie, an ally of [[Val Rhymin]] mentions Robert Minoru, his (presumed late) friend, once said that all things are possible, and says he misses the Minorus, appearing near tears when he thinks of them, and saying that the L.A. magic scene hasn\u2019t been the same without them: ''\"Good times.\"'' This past relationship to the Minorus is also revealed to Nico when the two confront.\n
