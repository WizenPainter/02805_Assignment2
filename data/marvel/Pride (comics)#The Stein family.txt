==The Stein family== ==\n'''Victor''' and '''Janet Stein''' (\"the Wise Men\") are [[Chase Stein]]'s parents. They are world-renowned brilliant [[Invention|inventors]] (Tony Stark was once impressed by their work)<ref name=\"IML#10\"/> who are known for making fortunes for what people believe are necessities.<ref>They supposedly made a fortune from creating a tool that removes the annoying plastic wrapping easily from a CD.</ref> They also made \"weaponized\" gloves called Fistigons, multi-spectral goggles and the transport ship \"the Leapfrog\".<ref name=\"Vol1#17\"/> When the Gibborim had called them for the first meeting, the Steins were in their laboratory. At the back of the Stein home is their workshop, which appears as a small shed. When entered, the space is equal to that of a large cave.<ref name=\"Vol1#4\">''Runaways'' #4</ref> The Steins are also responsible for the money the Pride obtains, as Victor revealed he and Janet had counterfeited the new fifty dollar bill within two minutes.<ref name=\"Vol1#14\">''Runaways'' #14</ref> The Steins have also created watches that zap electricity, watches that scan police radars and senses, creating the container that carries the soul they sacrifice, and they dress in scientific outfits for their villainous costumes.<ref name=\"Vol1#1\"/> Janet Stein's pregnancy is the reason the remaining Pride wished to have children, and started the idea of offering their place to a child.<ref name=\"Vol1#13\"/> Victor is the one parent often described as being the most abusive,<ref name=\"Vol2#24\">''Runaways'' vol. 2 #24</ref><ref>[http://runaways.mergingminds.org/showarticle.asp?section=10&fldAuto=376 Runaways: Vol. 1, #17] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009191156/http://runaways.mergingminds.org/showarticle.asp?section=10&fldAuto=376 |date=2007-10-09 }}</ref> as he first appears punching Chase across the face for getting C's, with Janet scolding slightly.<ref name=\"Vol1#1\"/> A remark from Chase implies that his father regularly beats him.<ref name=\"Vol1#4\"/> Chase later quotes his parents often argue.<ref name=\"Vol1#6\"/> On the night of the Rite of Thunder, Victor tells Geoffrey that he really loves his son,<ref name=\"Vol1#14\"/> and Janet later admits she doesn't know how her soul is, because of the murders.<ref name=\"Vol1#17\"/>\n\nWhen Chase receives an opportunity to bring Gert back to life, he immediately agrees to take it: sacrifice an innocent life and Gert would return alive.<ref name=\"Vol2#24\" />  Chase agrees to the deal and wishes to sacrifice himself, because he had realized he was innocent; Victor would often abuse Chase when he was young, hitting him with a Burbank [[phone book]], which Chase quotes as \"strong enough to hurt but not leave any marks\".<ref name=\"Vol2#24\"/> Janet would then put on the radio, so she wouldn't hear her son crying downstairs.<ref name=\"Vol2#24\"/> Victor would hurt him for getting a D in Algebra, a parking ticket, or even if he was just having a bad day.<ref name=\"Vol2#24\"/> Chase had never thought of them as good excuses, so he had begun to make up his own, and even believe them, until he realized that he was entirely innocent.<ref name=\"Vol2#24\"/>\n
