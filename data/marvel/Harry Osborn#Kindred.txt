==Kindred== =\nIt is revealed over the course of [[Nick Spencer]]'s run as writer on ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' that, upon dying, Harry's soul was transported to [[Hell]], where he encountered the demon [[Mephisto (Marvel Comics)|Mephisto]], who labels him as the '''Goblin Prince'''. The demon asks Harry why he never told Peter on his deathbed any of the schemes he had set in motion to torture him after his passing, with Harry confessing that there was no time, and that he was ashamed.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #74</ref> Harry's soul is kept in hell tortured by demons while the clone version maintains a life on Earth.\n\nMany years later, a demon, going by the name of '''Kindred''', rose through the ranks and ultimately hand picked [[Mysterio]] to assist him in carrying out a plan of retaliation against Peter Parker, whom Kindred held accountable for an unpardonable sin. When Kindred meets with [[Norman Osborn]] in Ravencroft, Norman's Cletus Kasady persona states to Kindred that he has a message for him from Norman, who states that he is \"so proud of him\".<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #31. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nNorman, cleansed of his sins via Sin-Eater, claimed to the clone of [[Ashley Kafka]] that Kindred was his son,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #50. Marvel Comics.</ref> and when Kindred revealed itself to Peter it had the face of Harry Osborn. Kindred torments Peter by showing him the corpses of his dead friends and family, putting Peter's soul through the reenactment of Harry Osborn's return,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #53. Marvel Comics.</ref> and killing him over and over again as Peter experienced flashbacks to better times with his friends.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #54. Marvel Comics.</ref> Norman is able to capture Kindred with the help of Kingpin and speaks to it believing it to be the true Harry, voicing regret over having birthed the sickness in Harry's mind. Planning to redeem the Osborn name, Norman states to Kindred that he will find the truth that he talked about. Spider-Man arrives stating to Norman that he would like to talk to him,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #56. Marvel Comics.</ref> and declares he is finished with Harry forever.<ref name=\":0\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #57.

At that moment she is captured by Kindred <ref name=\":0\" /> and later awakens to find herself a caged prisoner. She finds the non-demonized Harry Lyman is her cellmate, and he tells her that they have no chance of escape.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #66. Marvel Comics.</ref> Carlie learns from Harry that he was lured to Europe by Kindred after following a trail of transactions from several dormant Oscorp bank accounts. Arriving at one of his father's former real estate holdings (which bears a resemblance to the building that raised Sarah and Gabriel Stacy), Lyman was attacked and captured by Kindred. He has remained a prisoner for many months. Unbeknownst to Harry, Carlie is keeping something from him...the identity of the corpse she discovered in the morgue belongs to Harry Osborn himself.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #70. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nCarlie attempts to motivate Lyman, reminding him of his family. Harry tells her this is not the first time he has failed them, and that no matter how happy he is, how hard he tries to put things right, something is always there to remind him that none of it is real, and that none of it will ever last. After more coaxing from Carlie, Harry suddenly notices that the door to their cell is open and suggests there is a way to escape<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #71. Marvel Comics</ref> Harry and Carlie race through Kindred's catacombs, and find that some of the walls are easy to push over. They find Carlie's morgue on the other end of one, containing a body. Carlie warns Harry not to look, but he does anyway. It is also revealed through flashbacks dating back to Harry's childhood that the cause of most of Harry's personal problems, from addiction to insanity, comes from him having a tortured soul which was traded to the demon Mephisto by Harry's father in exchange for a more prosperous quality of life, which Norman had been struggling to provide for him and his son. Norman is reminded of these deeds when he visits the house in Europe, discovering two cloning pods as well as the old [[artificial intelligence]] unit which houses Harry's brain waves. This version of Harry taunts his father<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #72. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe A.I. Harry reveals to his father that his half-siblings [[Gabriel Stacy and Sarah Stacy|Gabriel and Sarah Stacy]] are not in reality Norman's children, and that he never had an intimate relationship with [[Gwen Stacy]]. Sarah and Gabriel were part of a major cloning conspiracy orchestrated by him, Mysterio, Mendell Stromm, and The Chameleon. Several versions of the twins were created, but each succumbed to cellular clone degeneration and died. When the latest models were perfected, they were sent out into the world to confront Peter. Gabriel  had one further model created that became involved in the ''American Son'' storyline. Now both twins have become host bodies for the AI Harry, which is why they have been taking Harry's form and have his memories, and it is revealed there were two Kindreds all along. Harry's A.I. reveals Mysterio rewired his father's memories to make him believe his son had always survived, when in truth he did not. Harry Lyman, uncovering his own body, confesses to Carlie that he knew all along he was never the true Harry, after he and Carlie find a portal that transports them back to his home, Harry checks in on a sleeping Liz and Normie before equipping himself with a goblin glider and pumpkin bombs, and heads back to Kindred's base to confront his final destiny.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #73. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn a final battle with the Kindreds, Norman reveals the A.I. Harry had been influenced by Mephisto the entire time and apologizes to Harry for selling his soul. Harry then tells Peter he \"made up\" the twins and fights with his friend against them. During the battle Harry tells Norman to get to safety; Norman is shocked at this to which Harry replies \"Guess the apple fell kinda far from the tree.\" When Harry steps between Norman and a blow from Gabriel's Kindred body, he is fatally wounded. Collapsing into Peter's arms, Harry tells Peter this was always how it was \"meant to be\" and dies. Doctor Strange decides to gamble with Mephisto for the fate of Harry Osborn's soul and succeeds. His victory exorcises Mephisto from the twins, allowing them to degenerate and pass on for a final time, and Harry's soul is freed from Mephisto's grasp.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Vol.5 #74.
