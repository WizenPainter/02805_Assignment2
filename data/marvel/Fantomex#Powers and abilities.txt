==Powers and abilities== \nFantomex has an external nervous system referred to as E.V.A. that emerged from his mouth during his time in the World and developed into a techno-organic flying saucer-like vessel. The relationship between E.V.A. and Fantomex is symbiotic, so if E.V.A. experiences pain when she is not within Fantomex, he will feel it as well. When E.V.A. is separated from his body, Fantomex feels no pain and seems able to ignore most injuries. Along with this symbiotic relationship, Fantomex is linked to E.V.A. via mind link. He can see through E.V.A.'s point of view and can take control of her movement. However, this requires concentration on the part of Fantomex. Moreover, E.V.A, as a bio-mechanical being, can reshape her body into a variety of forms, fly herself, and generate energy discharges to be used as weapons.<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 4 #11</ref>\n\nFantomex can create extremely realistic illusions (he calls this ability \"misdirection\"). This ability is based on \"reality skewing\", rather than telepathy or holographic projection.<ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' #14</ref><ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' vol. 4 #1</ref>\n\nFantomex has microtechnology laced into his blood; with nanites in his brain prohibiting him from believing in anything greater than himself, such as gods or any supernatural beings to the concept of true love.<ref>''Dark Reign: The List - Wolverine'' #1</ref><ref>''Uncanny X-Force'' vol. 2 #8</ref><ref>''X-Force'' vol. 4 #4</ref><ref>''X-Force'' vol. 4 #11</ref> He also maintains an internal back-up nervous system which can be engaged if E.V.A. is damaged. However, this system is less complex than E.V.A. and does not allow Fantomex to see colors.\n\nHe possesses a computerized mind similar to [[Sage (comics)|Sage]] which worked in tandem with his alternate minds and the Nano-Blood in his system to increase his intellect and analytical prowess.<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 4 #5</ref> It also gives him a similar ability to the former akin to biofeedback, the practice of bringing his physiology under his conscious control.<ref>''New X-Men'' #128</ref> To that extent he can affect pain resistance, self-healing and enhanced physical abilities such as registering frequencies beyond the hearing range of normal humans or using sheer strength to scale an inclined surface and possessing a healing factor.<ref>''Fear Itself: Uncanny X-Force'' #2</ref>\n\nFantomex can also enter a trance state and perform crucial tasks such as performing surgery on himself. In this state, he can also recover faster while placed in water. He can expertly read the body language of others in order to predict their attacks. He is a very skilled hand-to-hand combatant and a master of stealth techniques. His title in his birthplace, the World, was \"stealth-fighter\".\n\nBeing a superb marksman, Fantomex once used a special variety of ceramic bullets covered in sentient mutant skin that never missed their target (designed by Sir James Braddock, the father of Captain Britain and Captain Avalon) but he used his last of these against Archangel. He carries a variety of guns and other weapons.\n\nHis mask incorporates telepathy-blocking ceramics with additional night vision goggles. These allow his mind to remain completely unreadable, even facing the most powerful telepaths of the Marvel Universe (Professor X and the Shadow King among others).\n
