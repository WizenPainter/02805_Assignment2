==Main characters== \n*'''Randy O'Brien''',<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/rndobi.htm Randy O'Brien (New Universe, DP7, Antibody)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> nicknamed '''Antibody''', is a [[medical resident]] who can project from his body a dark figure of himself (also called an \"antibody\", a [[word play]] on the [[Antibody|medical term]]) that flies, can become [[Permeation|intangible]], and transfer its memories to another person by physical contact. At the beginning of the series, O'Brien can only project and within limits control one of these entities. Later he proves able to manifest multiple antibodies. They all looked exactly the same to anyone else, but he could tell them apart and gave each individual names. His first few were named after the Marx Brothers. He later developed the ability to \"wear\" an antibody like a bodysuit, and at one time four of them joined together around him to create a more powerful antibody suit for him. Shortly before the series ended, O'Brien becomes trapped inside an antibody when he is hit by [[The Pitt|Pitt]]-Juice. The antibodies he subsequently creates are only a few inches tall and he gave these names like \"Tink\" and \"Jiminy\". O'Brien has a romantic attraction to Charly Beck, but Randy's upbringing instilled a sort of aversive racism in him that left him uncomfortable with the idea of a relationship with a black woman. Later he got over these feelings and wanted to attempt a relationship with Charly, but she has begun shunning ''him'' because of his new appearance. He is [[The Draft (comics)|drafted into the Army's Paranormal Platoon]], but goes [[AWOL]], then moves to New York.\n*'''David Landers''', nicknamed '''Mastodon''', was a cheese factory worker who became stronger as new muscles grew into his body, an effect that caused him great pain at first. [[Mark Gruenwald]]'s description of Dave Landers's muscle growth was inspired by an article in a science magazine about a treatment in which [[electrical current]]s are used to contract a person's abdominal muscles, producing the equivalent of 500 [[sit-up]]s in a single minute.<ref name=\"DAK54\"/> He also found that the hair on his face (and what little he has on his head) grows at an astounding rate. He is able to lift over 15 tons and resist small-caliber gunfire. He has a crush on Stephanie through the entire series. He is [[The Draft (comics)|drafted into the Army's Paranormal Platoon]], but goes [[AWOL]], then moves to New York. \n*'''Jeff Walters''', nicknamed '''Blur''', is a fast food restaurant manager whose body vibrates so fast that he cannot stand still. He requires vast amounts of [[food]] for his accelerated metabolism and can move at superhuman speed. He started out overweight, but his powers and hyper-metabolism quickly shed the pounds. His family died in the [[The Pitt|destruction of Pittsburgh]]. He is [[The Draft (comics)|drafted into the Army's Paranormal Platoon]] and participates in [[The War (comics)|the War]]. After the events of ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'', he found himself on Earth-616 and became a member of the [[Squadron Supreme]] before the team disbanded, which led to Blur joining [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]\n*'''Charlotte \"Charly\" Beck''', nicknamed '''Friction''', was a dance student who acquired the power to make herself, anything she touched, and any other object she thought about within a limited range [[friction]]-free enough to make the object or person slide effortlessly. Over time, Beck learned to make her power object-specific or to increase friction to stick things together, and during ''[[The Draft (comics)|the Draft]]'' became a special [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operative, but her program was discontinued and she moved to New York, where she attempted a dancing career. \n*'''Dennis \"Scuzz\" Cuzinski''' is a teenage [[Dropping out|dropout]] who produces a [[corrosive]] substance from his skin, which he himself is immune to. He can increase his skin's production of the chemical, to the point of burning through a steel plate in 10 seconds, but cannot stop it, turning anything he wears into a tattered ruin within days and affecting objects such as bedsheets and furniture that he comes into regular contact with. He learns to form his chemical-laden saliva with his skin secretion into \"gobs\" or \"spitballs\" that he can throw, and to further increase production of the substance when angry or excited, making his body so caustic that it can incinerate flammable material on contact. For a while he was the leader of the Clinic's underage paranormals who called themselves The DDTeens. After the clinic shut down, a high speed chase with police ended with him crashing their car, killing two of them and seriously injuring the rest of the DDTeens. By the end of ''D.P. 7'', he becomes a member of the Cult of the White Event, which believes that paranormal powers are a gift from God. Because of this belief, he tries to assassinate the Cure, a paranormal with the power to remove others' paranormalities. As a result of the failed attempt, Scuzz and the Cure are both left powerless.\n*'''Stephanie Harrington''', initially nicknamed '''Viva''' but later known as '''Glitter''', is a housewife and mother of three with the power to heal and energize others by physical contact. The use of this power is accompanied by the appearance of twinkling stars. When not used to heal, her power makes her superhumanly strong (able to lift about 1 ton), fast (can run as fast as a speeding car), and agile (twice that of a normal human). She is recruited into the CIA during ''the Draft'' but her program is discontinued and she moves to New York. She eventually leaves her husband and develops some feelings for Dave Landers just before the end of the series. For a short time, she and her children moved back home to Wisconsin, but after being ostracized by their friends and neighbors, they return to New York at the end of the series. She finally responds to Dave's affections and admits to having feelings for him as well.\n*'''Lenore Fenzl''', nicknamed '''Twilight''', is a retired Latin teacher whose body produces \"[[Fatigue (physical)|fatigue]]-poison inducing [[bioluminescence]]\" that can [[Paralysis|paralyze]] and render unconscious individuals that are exposed to it. Fenzl's power requires her to remain covered over her entire body at all times, and she later discovers that exposing others to her bioluminescence renews her youth and vitality. After leaving the Clinic for the second time, she becomes a special CIA agent during ''the Draft''. She is killed on a mission in Brazil battling a paranormal creature called the Famileech.\n\nThe series grew to include several additional protagonists:\n*'''Miriam Sorenson''', nicknamed '''Sponge''', could absorb moisture from the air and release it as pressurized streams of water. She had an unrequited crush on Dave Landers, forming a love triangle. She was cured of her condition by '''the Cure''', a paranormal who could restore others to normal.\n*'''George Mullaney''', nicknamed '''Mutator''', changed form every 48 hours; thus, his appearance was often in a state of flux as he slowly altered from one mutation to another. His often repellent animal forms led most other residents of the Clinic to shun him, but he was always eager to prove himself. He was eventually cured of his parability by the Cure.  \n*'''[[Jenny Swensen (comics)|Jenny Swensen]]''' of ''[[Spitfire (New Universe)|Codename: Spitfire]]'' crossed over to ''D.P.7'' when the former series was canceled. Exposure to toxic sludge from [[The Pitt]] mutated her body and gave her metallic skin that could resist gunfire and enhanced strength. She was recruited to the CIA along with the other women, and later moved with them to New York. Known as '''Chrome''', she became a sidekick to the [[telekinetic]] '''Captain Manhattan''', one of the few costumed [[superhero]]es in the New Universe, whom she fell in love with. Though she seemed on the verge of having the Cure remove her powers at the end of the series, it was later revealed in the pages of ''[[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]'' that she chose to keep her powers.\n*'''Evan Heubner''', a young orphan who ended up at the Clinic; though he thought he had no paranormal powers, he discovered he could play host to one of Randy O'Brien's antibodies who he named '''Shadowman''', and could even jump into and \"ride\" inside the antibody. He later taught this trick to O'Brien. Evan was a member of the DDTeens along with Scuzz. Shadowman died saving Evan and Randy from a paranormal creature called the Famileech, but Randy created another antibody for Evan, which he promptly named '''Shadowman 2'''.\n
