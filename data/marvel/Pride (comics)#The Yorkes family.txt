==The Yorkes family== ==\n'''Dale''' and '''Stacey Yorkes''' (\"the Travelers\") are [[Gertrude Yorkes]]'s parents. They are [[time travel]]lers who posed as [[antique]] dealers. The two, using a special 4-D portal, had traveled all over time, and had commissioned a genetically-engineered dinosaur, mentally linking it with their daughter.<ref name=\"Vol1#17\"/> They had lived in the 87th century.<ref name=\"Vol1#17\"/> When the Gibborim had called them to the first meeting, Dale and Stacey had accidentally landed in 1985, where Stacey quotes was \"the worst decade of the century\".<ref name=\"Vol1#13\"/> They believed the Gibborim would make a better world, one that wasn't full of [[superhero]]es who had foiled their plans in the past (and presumably the future).<ref name=\"Vol1#17\"/><ref name=\"IGNReview#30\">[http://comics.ign.com/articles/884/884477p1.html Whedon's run finally ends.]</ref> The two have a distinct way of speech (unlike the rest of the Pride, they have older-fashioned speech),<ref name=\"Vol1#6\">''Runaways'' #6</ref> and often imply they know what will go on in the future.<ref name=\"Vol2#27\">''Runaways'' vol. 2 #27</ref> They dress in pilot styles resembling that of [[Amelia Earhart]], complete with the goggles, scarves, and gloves. It was later revealed their outfits were actually technical advances; their gloves cause fire and restraining shields.<ref name=\"Vol2#28\">''Runaways'' vol. 2 #28</ref><ref name=\"Vol2#29\">''Runaways'' vol. 2 #29</ref> The Yorkes appear as self-righteous, obnoxious people, particularly Stacey.<ref name=\"Vol2#28\"/> Gert had had a strong dislike of her parents because of an incident involving Gert's pet pig, which the Yorkes hated; after Gert had been playing with it, she had briefly left to answer the phone, and when she returned, she found it gone.  She suspected her parents of the disappearance.<ref name=\"Vol1#3\">''Runaways'' #3</ref>\n\nWhen the runaways are time-displaced to 1907, it was revealed the runaways had landed in a time the Yorkes were visiting, where the Yorkes are the heads of a super powered street gang known as the Sinners.<ref name=\"Vol2#27\"/> When Chase reveals Gert is dead to Dale, he snaps, prompting him to almost assault Chase with his fiery gloves.<ref name=\"Vol2#28\"/> Later on, Dale reveals the Yorkes have several kingdoms through time, and plan on destroying all of 1907 New York for the sake of their daughter. Unable to wipe their memories as she had already used that spell, Nico stops the Yorkes with her most complex spell yet (\"The show must go on\"), revealing a painful secret about the Yorkes: the Yorkes will remember everything they now know about their daughter's upcoming death as well as their own, but are enchanted to be unable to act on this knowledge in any way, even to each other; they cannot change the future or say anything that would cause a [[Grandfather Paradox]].<ref name=\"Vol2#30\">''Runaways'' vol. 2 #30</ref>\n
