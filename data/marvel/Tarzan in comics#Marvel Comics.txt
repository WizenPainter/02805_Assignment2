==Marvel Comics== ==\nIn 1977 the series moved to Marvel Comics, retitled as ''Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle''. Marvel published 29 issues from June 1977 to October 1979<ref name=\"Overstreet\" /><ref>{{gcdb series|id= 2408|title= ''Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle''}}</ref> and three ''Annual''s.<ref name=\"Overstreet\" /><ref>{{gcdb series|id= 2409|title= ''Tarzan Annual''}}</ref> It restarted the numbering rather than assuming that used by the previous publishers. The series was written by [[Roy Thomas]] and featured artwork by [[John Buscema]].<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Sanderson|first1 = Peter|author-link = Peter Sanderson|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1970s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 179|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Writer Roy Thomas and artist John Buscema created Marvel's new ''Tarzan'' series, based on author Edgar Rice Burroughs' character.}}</ref> Burroughs books adapted by Marvel include ''Tarzan of the Apes'', ''Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar'' and ''Jungle Tales of Tarzan''. Mark Evanier remarked that <blockquote>... the whole Marvel deal was doomed from the start. ... The foreign publishers did not want adaptations. Roy Thomas felt they should do adaptations. They wanted the Russ Manning versions, but John Buscema wanted to make it as much like the Joe Kubert version as possible. Also, the foreign publishers needed stories in fifteen-page increments, because most of the books feature thirty pages of material and two pages of ads. Everything that made the books commercial in America, made them uncommercial overseas.<ref name=\"DAK2\"/></blockquote> Marvel did not continue the ''Tarzan Family'' title, publishing instead a series on Burroughs' primary non-Tarzan character, ''[[John Carter, Warlord of Mars]]''. ''[[Marvel Comics Super Special|Marvel Super Special]]'' #29 (1983) featured a Tarzan story by writers Sharman DiVono and [[Mark Evanier]] and artist [[Dan Spiegle]].<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/37003/ ''Marvel Super Special'' #29] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>\n
